Before running
--------------

`har_to_object_times.py` requires  `har.py`, in the web-profiler repo. It is
included here as a submodule. To use it, run:

git submodule init
git submodule update


Output
------

`har_to_object_times.py` outputs two files for each har: a `.actions` file and
a `.csv` file. The CSV file contains details about each object (like size
before/after compression, the server hostname, the full URL, etc.). The actions
file is simpler and meant for Matteo's client. It contains four fields,
separated by spaces:

* Request start time (sec)
* Request slice sizes (tab-separated list of byte counts)
* Response slice sizes (tab-separated list of byte counts)
* Connection number
